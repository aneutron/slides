This is a two day course on git and gerrit
==========================================
The objective is a good understand of git and it's differences/similarities
to other source control systems + understanding of how to combine git
with gerrit.

The weight is 2/3 git and 1/3 gerrit.

git
===
philosophy of git.
understand branching in git.
understand sha1 in git, treeish and more.

gerrit
======
undestand the options that you have when you commit to gerrit and the build fails.
	you can either add a commit and squash
	or you can create a brand new commit with the fix.

Installation requirements
=========================
gerrit server.
	as VM?
	as local linux?
	on the web?
github access.
	or maybe we should have local git so that we could directly
	pull and push.

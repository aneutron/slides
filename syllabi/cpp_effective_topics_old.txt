Effective STL:
	Performance of various STL data structures.
	Correct iteration of data strcutures.
	Modifying containers while iterating.
	STL allocators.
	Complex keys for maps, sets...
Boost:
	Bind.
	Flyweight.
	Tuple.
	Circular buffer.
	Intrusive containers (compare to STL).
	Pool.
	Scope Exit.
	Serialisation.
	Tokenizer (compare to STL, ACE).
boost exercises:
	read and write records from the disk using the serialisation (boost).
	use the pool for allocation.
	use Flyweight to hold the objects.
	examples: yes - for each topic.
Linux systems programming:
	IO:
		raw APIs.
		open flags.
		read and write semantics.
		read and write performance.
		all other apis (directories etc...)
	signals:
		overview.
		problems with signal handling.
		using signal handling for program termination.
		signal handers interaction with "regular code"
		(-EINTR, siginterrupt)
		blocking signal.
		mention linux specific signal handling functions.
	multi process: (emphasis)
		entire chapter.
	Posix threads: (emphasis)
		No theory (covered in multi core chapter).
		Don't explain all APIS.
		Show only Linux specific APIs which are not exposed via ACE.
	SYSV interprocess communication: (emphasis)
		semaphores:
			performance.
			when to use.
			when not to use.
			compare to futex, condition, atomics,...
		mmap of regular file:
			performance.
			how is caching done.
		shared memory:
			the two APIs of shared memory.
Multi core:
	Multicore application programming: For windows, Linux and Oracle Solaris.
	Definitions.
	Difference between multicore and multi-cpu.
	CPU caches.
		(chapter 1).
		how to optimize cache utilization.
		how to measure cache utilization.
		how to avoid cache line sharing.
	Chapter 3 (identifying opportunities for parallelism).
		Concepts and definition:
			mutex
			futexs
			semaphores
			RWLock and other locks.
			spinlocks.
			Lock free algorithms.
			Deadlock, livelock.
			Memory sharing.
			Message queues.
			Barriers
			Conditions.
			Machine memory barrier.
			Compiler barrier.
	intro open mp:
		chapter 7 from the book.
		show interesting examples.
		show what can be done - don't explain every #pragma.
		when to use, compare to regular multi threading.
		exercise: write a merge sort with open mp. optimize it.
	low level synchronisation:
		atomic operations on intel using icc.
		memory barrier on icc.
		compiler barrier on icc.
	lock free algorithms tour (chapter 8):
		lock free circular buffer.
		lock free hash table.
	exercise: write a cyclic buffer to serve as a logging buffer.
		write APIs to log to the buffer and protect the buffer
		only via atomic operations.
Real time design patterns:
	Memory:
		avoiding memory allocation (obstack).
		using a memory cache.
		using per thread cache (the problems).
	concurrency:
		fine grained locking.
		randezvous.
		simulteneous locking.
		double checked locking.
	distribution:
		proactor (exapmles from ACE).
		object monitor.
	advanced techniques:
		Copy on write.
		RCU.
		full multi versioning.
	exercise: multi threaded server with proactor and randezvous between the worker
		threads.
Linux networking:
	Intro:
		IPv4 vs IPv6.
		tcp, udp, broadcast, multicast, unicast
		linux networking internals.
		/proc
		/sys
	problems with acquiring the same address (e.g. on system crash).
		sharing of file descriptors between processes.
		working with raw sockets.
		special flags for sockets.
		async io.
			signal driver.
			epoll driver.
		out of band data.
	tools for monitoring networking apps:
		(take the list from my tools).
		linux network stack:
	SNMP:
		theory.
		show example of SNMP server and client on Linux.
	exercise:
		implement a multi threaded web server.
		use: async io (epoll/signal driven with thread pool).

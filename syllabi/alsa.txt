Syllabus for a full course on ALSA
==================================
Requirements:
	C programming (for almost all sections of this course)
	Linux Kernel programming (needed for the big section about writing ALSA drivers)
		This means *Linux* kernel programming. kernel programming in other
		operating systems does not count here.
Length of course:
	Still not known. I need to write up all the material to see how long the
	course will take.
